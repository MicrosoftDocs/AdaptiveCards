# Extensibility

Each SDK allows you to override the rendering of any element, or even add support for entirely new elements that you define.  For example, you can change the `Input.Date` renderer to emit your own custom control while still retaining the rest of the output of the renderer. Or you can add support for a custom `Rating` element to you define.

For example code, please expand the **SDK** node on the left -> **Rendering Cards** -> **the SDK you'd like to use** -> **Extensibility**
