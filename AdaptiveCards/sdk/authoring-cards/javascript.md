# JavaScript SDK for creating cards

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The library for serializing JSON is still in development and your milage may vary.

As we described in the [Getting Started](../../authoring-cards/getting-started.md), an Adaptive Card is nothing more than a serialized JSON object of a card object model.  To make it easy to manipulate the object model we have defined some libraries which define a strongly typed class hierarchy that is easy to serialize/deserialize json.

You can use any tooling that you want to create the adaptive card json.

The `adaptivecards` npm package defines a library for working with adaptive cards in javascript

## To install
```console
npm install adaptivecards
```

## Example

The following API shows how to construct an Adaptive Card using the object model and serialize it to JSON.

```typescript
let card = new Adaptive.AdaptiveCard();
card.version = new Adaptive.Version(1, 0);

let textBlock = new Adaptive.TextBlock();
textBlock.text = "Hello World";

card.addItem(textBlock);

let json = card.toJSON();
```
