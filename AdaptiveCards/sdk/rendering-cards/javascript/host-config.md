# Host config - JavaScript

```js
// Create an AdaptiveCard instance
var adaptiveCard = new AdaptiveCards.AdaptiveCard();

// Set its hostConfig property unless you want to use the default Host Config
// Host Config defines the style and behavior of a card
adaptiveCard.hostConfig = new AdaptiveCards.HostConfig({
    fontFamily: "Segoe UI, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif"
    // More host config options
});

// Render the card to an HTML element:
var renderedCard = adaptiveCard.render();
```

## Customization

There are 3 ways to customize the adaptive card rendering: 
1. Host Config
2. CSS styling
3. Custom element rendering

### HostConfig 

A [Host Config](../../../rendering-cards/host-config.md) is a shared configuration object that all renderers understand. This allows you to define common styles (e.g., font family, font sizes, default spacing) and behaviors (e.g., max number of actions) that will be automatically interpreted by each platform renderer. 

The goal is that the native UI generated by each platform renderer will look very similar with minimal work on your part.

```javascript
var renderOptions = {
    ...
    hostConfig: {
        // Define your host config object here
        // See the HostConfig docs for details
    }
};
```
