# Host config - .NET WPF

A [Host Config](../../../rendering-cards/host-config.md) is a shared configuration object that all renderers understand. This allows you to define common styles (e.g., font family, font sizes, default spacing) and behaviors (e.g., max number of actions) that will be automatically interpreted by each platform renderer. 

The goal is that the native UI generated by each platform renderer will look very similar with minimal work on your part.

```csharp
// Construct programmatically
renderer.HostConfig = new AdaptiveHostConfig()
{
    FontStyles = new FontStylesConfig()
    {
        Default = new FontStyleConfig()
        {
            FontFamily = "Consolas",
            FontSizes = {
                Small = 15,
                Default = 20,
                Medium = 25,
                Large = 30,
                ExtraLarge= 40
            }
        },
    }
};

// Or parse from JSON
renderer.HostConfig = AdaptiveHostConfig.FromJson(@"{
    ""fontStyles"": {
        ""default"": {
            ""fontFamily"": ""Consolas"",
            ""fontSizes"": {
                ""small"": 15,
                ""default"": 20,
                ""medium"": 25,
                ""large"": 30,
                ""extraLarge"": 40
            }
        }
    }}");
```
