# Getting started - .NET Image

As we described in [Getting Started](../../../authoring-cards/getting-started.md) page, an Adaptive Card is a JSON-serialized card object model. This library makes it easy to render that JSON into into a PNG image.

This package can even be used on a server to generate images, and implements all the "magic STA thread" goo for you. 

## NuGet install

[![Nuget install](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Wpf.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Wpf)

```console
Install-Package AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Wpf -IncludePrerelease
```

## Next steps

See [Render a card](render-a-card.md) for the next steps!
