# Native styling - .NET HTML

While Host Config will get you most of the way there on each platform, it's likely that you will have to do some native styling on each platform. 

HTML makes this easy by adding CSS classes to every element.

| All Actions | ac-pushButton | 
| Select Actions | ac-selectable |
| Action.OpenUrl  | ac-action-openUrl |
| Action.ShowCard | ac-action-showCard |
| Action.Submit  | ac-action-submit  |
| ActionSet | ac-actionset |
| Column | ac-column |
| ColumnSet | ac-columnset |
| Container | ac-container |
| All Inputs | ac-input |
| Input.ChoiceSet | ac-multichoiceInput  |
| Input.Date | ac-dateInput |
| Input.Number | ac-numberInput |
| Input.Text | ac-textInput |
