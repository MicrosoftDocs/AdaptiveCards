# Partners 

Adaptive Cards are the most powerful when they benefit a broad range of developers. Our vision is to create a shared ecosystem were developers can write and share content across multiple platforms. Our goal is to work in cooperation with communities and companies to build out this vision and develop a universal card exchange framework for developers.


If you are interested in joining the Adaptive Cards ecosystem, feel free to reach out directly on GitHub.
