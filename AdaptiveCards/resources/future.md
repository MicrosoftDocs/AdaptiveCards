# Future work

While we have made excellent progress defining adaptive cards, there is still lots of work to do. Our hope is that through active developer communities like botness, and great partners like Slack and Kik, we can create a great ecosystem of cross-platform cards.

## Roadmap

You can see our [current roadmap here](https://aka.ms/acroadmap).
