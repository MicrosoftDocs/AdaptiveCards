# Adaptive Cards for Windows Developers



## Timeline

The first Windows experience to supports Adaptive Cards is Timeline, a brand new experience first introduced in Windows 10 1803.

### UserActivity API

The [`Windows.ApplicationModel.UserActivities.UserActivity`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.useractivities.useractivity) API is what populates an Activity into Timeline.

The Adaptive Card will be supplied via the `Content` property of `VisualElement`, as seen below:

```csharp
UserActivity userActivity = await channel.GetOrCreateUserActivityAsync(activityId, new HostName("contoso.com"));
userActivity.ActivationUri = new Uri("rss-reader:article?" + article.Link);
userActivity.DisplayText = article.Title; //used for details tile text
userActivity.VisualElements.Content = AdaptiveCardBuilder.CreateAdaptiveCardFromJson(jsonString);
await userActivity.SaveAsync();
```
